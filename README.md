Train Scheduling System

# Train Scheduler

### Overview

In this train schedule application we incorporate Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions

  * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * This app should be able to calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines should be able to view same train times.
